# 5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

# •	 Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# •	 Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

favorite_fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Orange"]

# Check if "Apple" is in the list
if "Apple" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like Apples!")

# Similarly, you can check for other fruits
if "Mango" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like Mangos!")

if "Orange" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like Oranges!")

# You can add more fruits to the list and corresponding if statements
if "Banana" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like Bananas!")

if "Grapes" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like Grapes!")
