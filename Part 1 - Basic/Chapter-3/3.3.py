# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

transportation_list = ["Honda motorcycle", "R15", "BMW"]

print("I would like to own a",transportation_list[0])
print("I would like to go on",transportation_list[1])
print("I would like to have",transportation_list[2])
