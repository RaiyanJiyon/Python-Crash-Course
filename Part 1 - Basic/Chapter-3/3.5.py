# 3-5. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

# Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

# Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

#Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list


inviting_list = ["Mujahid", "Ishaq", "Sabbir"]

print(inviting_list[0]+", i like to inviting you to dinner.")
print(inviting_list[1]+", i like to inviting you to dinner.")
print(inviting_list[2]+", i like to inviting you to dinner.")

# for some space 
print("\n")

# printing who can't join the dinner party 
print(inviting_list[2],"are not comming in dinner.")

# for some space 
print("\n")

# modified inviting_list person name
inviting_list = ["Mujahid", "Ishaq", "Tamim"]

print(inviting_list[0]+", i like to inviting you to dinner.")
print(inviting_list[1]+", i like to inviting you to dinner.")
print(inviting_list[2]+", i like to inviting you to dinner.")
