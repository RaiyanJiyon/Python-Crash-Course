# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

friends_name = ["Ishaq", "Sabbir", "Tamim", "Gourab", "Mahabub"]

print("Have a good day",friends_name[0])
print("Have a good day",friends_name[1])
print("Have a good day",friends_name[2])
print("Have a good day",friends_name[3])
print("Have a good day",friends_name[4])
